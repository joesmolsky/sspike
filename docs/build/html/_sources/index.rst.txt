Welcome to sspike's documentation!
==================================

`sspike` (simulated supernovae projectiles inducing KamLAND events) is a python package (in development) for simulating supernovae neutrino event rates in KamLAND.  `SNOwGLoBES` and `snewpy` handle most of the physics.  sspike's purpose is to compare several supernovae simulations (from snewpy) in a single detector (using SNOwGLoBES).  It was created for KamLAND, but other detectors could be added.  (In *Peanuts*, Spike is Snoopy's brother.)
